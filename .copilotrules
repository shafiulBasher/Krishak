# Technical Constraints
1.  **Language:** Use JavaScript for all new files.
2.  **Styling:** Use TailwindCSS for all styling. Do not use plain CSS files.
3.  **Database:** Use Mongoose for schemas. Ensure strict typing for all models.
4.  **Frontend Structure:**
    * Use Functional Components with React Hooks.
    * Use 'lucide-react' for icons.
    * Keep components small and modular.
5.  **Backend Structure:**
    * Follow the Controller-Service-Repository pattern.
    * Use 'express-async-handler' for error handling.

# Project Specifics (Refer to PRD.md for details)
* **Roles:** Farmer, Buyer, Transporter, Admin.
* **Key Logic:**
    * The "Fair Price Calculator" must sum inputs (Seed + Fertilizer + Labor) and apply a margin logic.
    * The "Transporter Status" must strictly follow: Assigned -> Picked -> In-Transit -> Delivered.

# Vibe Coding Instructions
* Don't provide lengthy explanations. Provide the code blocks immediately.
* If a requirement is missing (e.g., specific field validation), make a reasonable industry-standard assumption (e.g., "Phone number must be 11 digits for BD").
* Always include comments for complex logic (like the pricing algorithms).
